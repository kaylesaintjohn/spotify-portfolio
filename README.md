# Spotify-inspired Personal Portfolio

First iteration of my personal website.

I got the idea to create a website based on the Spotify's app design when I read an [article](https://www.campaignlive.com/article/love-this-spotify-responds-college-students-viral-spotify-themed-resume/1709360) on Linkedin about a student who created a Spotify-themed resume. Being that Spotify is _probably_ my most used application - and I am a huge fan of the app's aesthetics - I just went for it.

This is my first attempt at using TailwindCSS and I had a lot of fun developing this portfolio.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
